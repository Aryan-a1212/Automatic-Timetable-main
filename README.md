**Automatic Timetable Generator** is a tool designed to simplify the creation of class schedules, course timetables, or any recurring event schedule.  It automates the process of assigning resources (teachers, classrooms, etc.) to time slots while considering constraints such as availability, room capacity, and course prerequisites.

_**Key Features**_ :-

**Automated Scheduling** :- Automatically generates timetables based on defined parameters and constraints.

**Constraint Management** :- Handles various constraints, including teacher availability, classroom capacity, course prerequisites, and student preferences.

**Conflict Resolution** :- Identifies and resolves scheduling conflicts, ensuring no double-bookings or resource clashes.

**Customizable Parameters** :- Allows users to define parameters such as time slots, days of the week, number of classes, and resource availability.

**Interactive Interface** :- Provides an intuitive interface for inputting data, viewing generated timetables, and making manual adjustments.

**Reporting and Export** :- Generates reports and exports timetables in various formats (e.g., PDF, CSV).

**User Management** :- Manages user accounts and permissions for accessing and modifying timetables.

_**Technologies Used**_ :-

**Frontend** :- HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React

**Backend** :- Node.js, Python (with Flask/Django), or other suitable backend framework

**Database** :- PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or other suitable database system

**Scheduling Algorithm** :- Constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) solver or other suitable optimization algorithm.
